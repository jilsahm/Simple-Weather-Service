### Weather fetcher ###
☐ Let it use the ObjectDb for persisetence.

### Persistence ###
☐ Polish POJOs for ObjectDB persistence (Weather, WeatherEntry and so on).
☐ The WeatherPattern enum needs to get a fix because the weather values need to be stored as doubles
☐ Write the actual ObjectDB api for the programm.
    ☐ Saving weather
    ☐ Loading weather (all, a specific one, range from to)
    ☐ Deleting weather

### RESTful ###
☐ Handle different requests (Actual weather, weather range, and so on).
☐ Let the RESTful controller dump real weather-JSON instead of dummy ones.

### Extras ###
☐ Maybe add a DebugFrontend with a view of all collected weather data.
☐ Migrate from native Sockets to Spring for maximum overengineering.
